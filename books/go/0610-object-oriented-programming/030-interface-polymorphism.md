Title: Interface & Polymorphism

Body:
Interfaces provide a way to specify the behaviour of an object, if something can do this then it can be used here. an interface defines a set of methods, but these methods do not contain code as they are abstract or the implemntation is left to the user of the interface. unlike most Object Oriented languages interfaces can contain variables in Go.

Polymorphism is the essence of object-oriented programming: the ability to treat objects of different types uniformly as long as they adhere to the same interface. Go interfaces provide this capability in a very direct and intuitive way

    package main

    type Runner interface {
        Run()
    }

    type Admin struct {
        Username, Password string
    }

    func (admin Admin) Run() {
        fmt.Println("Admin ==> Run()");
    }

    type User struct {
        ID uint64
        FullName, Email string
    }

    func (user User) Run() {
        fmt.Println("User ==> Run()")
    }

    // RunnerExample takes any type that fullfils the Runner interface
    func RunnerExample(r Runner) {
        r.Run()
    }

    func main() {
        admin := Admin{
            "zola",
            "supersecretpassword",
        }

        user := User{
            1,
            "Zelalem Mekonen",
            "zola.mk.27@gmail.com",
        }

        RunnerExample(admin)

        RunnerExample(user)
        
    }
